| Availability | 200 status codes or !5** status codes.  This shows how available the app is by showing the successful codes vs unsuccessful codes.     | 99%                                                                                                         |
| Latency      | round trip web request ms.  Latency metrics track how long it takes for a user to do something, whether thats loading a web page or making a database call. We want to make sure that the 90% percentile of round trip ms is less than 100ms     | 90% of requests below 100ms                                                                                 |
| Error Budget | failed requests / total requests.  Error budget shows how many errors are allowed within a certain timeframe.    | Error budget is defined at 20%. This means that 20% of the requests can fail and still be within the budget |
| Throughput   | total number of HTTP requests.  Tracks the amount of traffic going through the application.  Tracking this is helpful because it can indicate when its time to scale up or down.   | 5 RPS indicates the application is functioning                                                              |
